# NER

This repository contains my source code for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) project using custom labels on a novel dataset. I examined the performance of three popular Transformer based pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) and compared the results with and without additional pre-training on a NER specific dataset.
